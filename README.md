Through these exercises, I've learned how to conduct data analysis, starting with data cleaning â€“ understanding how to handle missing values and address outliers. Moving on to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I've gained proficiency in using statistical and visualization techniques to delve into data distributions and correlations. This enables the discovery of potential patterns or trends within the data. Finally, I've acquired the skills to model data and evaluate the performance of models to determine their effectiveness.
